# - FFOXWEBSHIT -
## Now what the f#ck is this 'FFOXWEBSHIT'?
The name is quite self explanatory to be honest, it is my new tab wallpaper for firefox :D
### Features
- A search bar, but not just any search bar, a simple, non cluttered one. When you press enter, the address bar at the top is just what is required, being https://google.com/search?q=hello+world, instead of https://www.google.com/search?q=hello+world&etc+etc+etc, and this is good for two reasons, one being that its no longer an eyesore, second being that google isn't stealing your search information!
- The date and a clock (digital not analogue ya 19th century bastud).
- Zigma the Sigma walking around on the bottom. He will turn around every so often, when you click him, or when he touches the sides of the screen. When the screen's height changes, so does Zigma the Sigma!
