### Important info

To any self proclaimed "Coding Crackheads" or "Namespace Nerds" or "Github Geeks", just know that as of writing this, I have used markdown files for less than an hour, know some basic syntax, and learnt it just to write this goofy little sh#thole of a readme file.


## Who tf is this Jessy KDM guy?

### Personal shyt

Good morning, gang! My name is Jessy, and it would've been Jesse but thats not the case because of:

```
def choose_name(child):
    global me, my_parents
    name = random.choice(["Mike", "Charlie", "Bob", "Tom", "Liam", "Oliver", "James", "Pikachu", "George", "Jacob", "etc"]) # yk like common boys names n shit
    if child == me:
        name = "Jesse"
    if my_parents.think_im_gonna_be_special_for_some_reason:
        name = intentionally_mispell_name_to_make_me_unique_or_sum(name)
    return name
```
So yeah, um, thats why my name is like that. If I was a d#ckhead, this would even benefit me, as I'd have a reason to pick a fight with anyone cuz they can't spell my name, but I'm not a d#ckhead (as far as I'm aware), so it doesn't really affect me much.

My friends and family say I'm quite smart, but I don't like calling myself too good / bad at anything, as I don't want to be labelled as a narcissist.

### Coding capabilities

I'd say I'm quite mediocre at coding, even though it is my passion and a web developer is my dream job. On a scale of 1 - 10 (relative for me, i.e. if I say im 7/10 in python but you think you are 3/10 in javascript or something, odds are you are still far better at js than I am at python), this is how good I think I am at some programming languages:

1. Python - 7/10
2. GDscript (basically python but ok) - 6/10
3. C# - 4/10
4. HTML - 3/10
5. C - 2.5/10
6. JS & CSS & Lua - 2/10 **(tie)**
7. C++ - 1.5/10
8. Java - 1/10
9. A lot of thing I haven't heard of - 0.1/10
