## Now what the f#ck is this 'digging game'?

Hi, um, so I made a lil game. Right now its in version 1.0 (don't verify that), and it's exactly what you think it is - A game about digging!

### Features (as of updating this so probably out of date idk just look at the code u lot probably know that):
- [x] Movement
- [x] A bunch of different ores (stone, coal, gold, diamond)
- [x] A guide for the controls, including how to close it (most useful control)
- [ ] Saving and loading sh#t
- [ ] A list of the recent ores you collected
- [ ] Enemies that chase and try to slaughter you
- [ ] Items
- [ ] Materials
- [ ] A way to escape (win basically)
- [ ] A village after escaping
